#ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease is a brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking 
skills, and, eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks. In most people with 
Alzheimer’s, symptoms first appear later in life. Estimates vary, but experts suggest that more 
than 6 million Americans, most of them age 65 or older, may have dementia caused by 
Alzheimer’s. Brain cell connections and the cells themselves degenerate and die, eventually 
destroying memory and other important mental functions. Memory loss and confusion are the 
main symptoms. No cure exists, but medication and management strategies may temporarily
improve symptoms. It associates many risk factors in Alzheimer disease and a need of the 
time to get accurate, reliable, and sensible approaches to make an early diagnosis to achieve 
prompt management of the disease. Data mining is a commonly used technique for 

processing enormous data in the healthcare domain. Researchers apply several data mining 
and machine learning techniques to analyse huge complex medical data, helping healthcare 
professionals to predict Alzheimer disease. The proposed method is to build a machine 
learning model capable of classifying the person has Alzheimer disease or not. Different 
algorithms are compared and the best model is used for predicting the outcome.

#PROPOSED SYSTEM
The proposed method is to build a machine learning model using classification 
technique predict for Alzheimer Disease. The process involves data collection where past 
data related to Alzheimer Disease are gathered. Data mining is a commonly used technique 
for processing enormous data in the healthcare domain. The Alzheimer disease if found 
before proper treatment can save lives. Machine learning is now applied and especially used 
in healthcare where it reduces manual effort and a better model reduces error less that leads 
to saving life. Data analysis is done on the dataset and appropriate identification of variables 
that dependent variables and independent variables are found. Then proper machine learning 
algorithms are applied on the dataset where the pattern of data is learnt. After applying 
different algorithms a better predict outcome.


#ADVANTAGES
1. The data used in this study will not be complex as MRI and data analysis will be easy.
2. Performance metrics of different algorithms are compared and the better prediction is 
made.
3. It uses Machine Learning Algorithm



#conclusion

As there is increase in number of deaths due to Alzheimer’s disease, it has become 
mandatory to develop a system to predict Alzheimer’s disease effectively and accurately. 
This study is based on the comparison and evaluation of recent work done in the prognosis 
and prediction of Alzheimer’s disease using Machine Learning Methods. For predicting 
Alzheimer’s disease in patient, we collect dataset from kaggle. The analytical process started 
from data cleaning and processing, missing value, Exploration data analysis. Then the dataset 
has been used to train Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree 
Classifier, Naive Baye’s Models. For evaluating performance metrics are precision, recall, f1-
score, specificity, sensitivity and accuracy. The result of this study indicates that the Logistic 
Regression algorithm is the most efficient algorithm with best accuracy score of 68.42 % for 
prediction of Alzheimer’s disease. To predict the Alzheimer’s disease using Machine 
Learning algorithms is successfully implemented and gives greater prediction accuracy 
results.
